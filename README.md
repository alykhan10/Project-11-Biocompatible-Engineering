# Project #11: Biocompatible Engineering
# Prototyping an Ultrasonic Sensor to Detect Myocardial Infarctions 

● Assessed for inconsistencies in cardiovascular activity following post-processing of electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms                 
● Sampled a 12x12 array of piezoelectric transducers with high beam ultrasound waves to enable doppler frequency shift          
● Proposed a thin, wearable elastomer sheet as an inert biomaterial for the embedded micro-electromechanical system
