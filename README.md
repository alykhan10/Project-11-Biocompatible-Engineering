# Project #12: Retinal Degeneration 
# Validating Stem Cell-Based Photoreceptor Therapies for Vision Restoration

● Conducted extensive literature review to outline anatomical, physiological, and pathological causes of vision loss                
● Assessed 3 state-of-the-art treatments: bionic eye implants, stem cell transplants, and glial cell reprogramming                   
● Identified sub-retinal cell culture as the most optimal solution based on cost, biocompatibility, and clinical viability
